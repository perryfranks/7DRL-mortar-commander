decouple the game engine, controls, win state, enemies

what will be the same between the game?

enemies

some procgen

ranged attacks

maybe equipment

menu system



what will be different?

The turn order to a degree

Player can do any number of moves before next turn

the progen

the resources

enemy attack patterns

having multple friends plus friendy AI

no leveling

So having some way to turn these scpits off without having to deal with that stuff


What do we want to be robust for the jam?
what the engine can run with

colors and ui are easy to implement and change
    the colors are currenty named for the game maybe a further generic set would be good

    maybe the observer pattern would be useful

load controls from a config

currently the player =
    can move
    attack on bump
    equip things
    iteract with things
